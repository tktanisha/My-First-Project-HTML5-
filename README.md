# My-First-Project-HTML5
this is my first git repository as well as my first project in the journey of MERN developer.

this is the basic portfolio web pages .

my purpose behind this project is  to apply the knowledge I learned about HTML.
I wanted to put that new knowledge to use by building something of my own, to see how I could implement what I learned.
Creating this project gave me a chance to practice the skills I gained from studying HTML.
Building the project helped solidify my understanding of HTML and where different elements should be placed.


Tech-Stack used is only HTML5
